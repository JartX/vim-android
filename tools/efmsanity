## Vim error format is both powerful and limited at the same time. It can be
## used to match almost any message format from any compiler, linter, checker.
## Problems arise when that tool or tools output error messages that are similar
## or too generic to create useful matches. This script tries to aleviate some
## of the pain points found in the output of gradle.

## Taken from the errorformat example for javac. Changes tabs to single spaces.
/\^$/s/\t/\ /g;

## Delete empty lines
/^\s*$/d;

## Delete lines that start with "> ". Errors in xml resources print the same
## twice, once without the > and again with the >. We remove the ones that
## start with > as these appreas within the FAILURE: multi-line error causing
## issues.
/^> /d;

## Move all the strings that start with ">" outside the block that starts wirh
## FAILURE: string.
##
## This is needed for AAPT errors that insist to appear after the FAILURE:
## causing issues with our multi-line errorformat.
##
##/^FAILURE:/,/^>/{/^>/{G;b};/^FAILURE:/{h;d};H;d};

## Make all AndroidManifest.xml errors one liners to simplify the errorformat
## string.
:x /AndroidManifest.xml:.*[Warning|Error]:$/ { N; s/\n//g ; bx };

## Magic code to add two spaces to convert this text:
##
##    FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
##
##    * What went wrong:
##    Execution failed for task ':Join:kaptDebugKotlin'.
##    > Compilation error. See log for more details
##
##    * Try:
##    Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.
##
##    BUILD FAILED
##
## To this text:
##
##    FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
##
##    * What went wrong:
##      Execution failed for task ':Join:kaptDebugKotlin'.
##    > Compilation error. See log for more details

##
## Note the added spaces to the strings after the lines with "*" at the
## beginning.
##
## We do this as we consider all lines that starts with two spaces as
## info messages in the multi-line errorformat.
